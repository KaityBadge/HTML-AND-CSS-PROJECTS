                        Grace Hopper (1906–1992) was an American computer scientist and U.S. Navy rear admiral. She
                        developed the first compiler for a computer programming language and contributed to the creation
                        of COBOL, a widely used business programming language. Hopper was a key figure in making
                        programming more accessible and coined the term "debugging." Known for her leadership and
                        mentorship, she received numerous awards and remained an influential figure in tech throughout
                        her life.

                <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
            </a>

            <p>
                Grace Hopper was born on December 9, 1906, in New York City. She showed an early interest in mathematics
                and science, and as a child, she disassembled alarm clocks to understand how they worked. Hopper
                attended Vassar College, where she earned a degree in mathematics and physics in 1928. She went on to
                pursue graduate studies at Yale University, earning a master’s degree in mathematics in 1930 and a Ph.D.
                in 1934. Her academic achievements laid the foundation for her future groundbreaking work in computer
                science.

                <h3>Career</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                Grace Hopper’s career began in academia before she joined the U.S. Navy during World War II, where she
                worked on the Mark I, one of the first electromechanical computers. After the war, she continued to
                contribute to computer science, developing the first compiler—a program that translates written code
                into machine-readable instructions.
            </p>
            <p>This innovation led to the creation of high-level programming languages, including COBOL,
                which became
                widely used in business and government. Hopper also worked as a trailblazer for women in technology,
                mentoring others and advocating for accessible programming.
            </p>
            <p>Throughout her career, she received numerous honors, including the Presidential Medal of
                Freedom, and
                remained an influential figure in tech until her death in 1992.

                <h3>Retirement</h3>
            </a>
            <p> After retiring from the U.S. Navy in 1966, Grace Hopper continued to make significant
                contributions to
                the field of computing. She joined Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), where she worked as a senior
                consultant, promoting the use of computers in business and government. In 1967, she was recalled to
                active duty in the Navy, where she served as a rear admiral until her final retirement in 1986.
            </p>
            <p> Even after retiring from the Navy, Hopper remained active in the tech community, giving
                lectures and
                advocating for computer science education, particularly for women in STEM. She continued to receive
                recognition for her pioneering work and remained a prominent figure in computing until her death in
                1992.

            <p>
                In the first part of her lecture, Hopper sets the stage for a vision of the future where technology is
                more integrated with human needs and where programming is simplified and accessible to a wider range of
                people. She stresses the importance of education in helping the next generation understand and shape the
                future of computing. Her visionary thinking about data, hardware, software, and people continues to
                resonate in today's world of interconnected, data-driven technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                This lecture is a remarkable blend of technical insight and philosophical reflection, showcasing Grace
                Hopper’s leadership in both the development of computer science and her advocacy for making technology
                work for people.
