		<p> Here is a review found online: <p>
		
		<blockquote cite="https://www.eatthis.com/trader-joes-cereal-taste-test/">
		The look: The oat clusters were huge and the mix included a lot of nuts: pecans, almonds, and Brazil nuts, too.
		The taste: What a letdown. The flakes tasted almost stale and didn't have that satisfying crunch of the OG cereal.
